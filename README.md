## Lyrics

```
breaking the chains so just shout out my name
while i try to affirm in thy place
xp aligned to a vapour 
life still unassigned 
i don't leave it to fate
coz i'd do it again

forward march is livid as
i don't miss the oblivion 
folding in on the bass
we don't drill we just purify 

it's the best you can do
just following traits

```
